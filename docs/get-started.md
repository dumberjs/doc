# Get Started

Let's scaffold a front-end SPA project using dumber bundler. We use ["makes"](https://github.com/makesjs/makes) to help the scaffolding.

```bash
npx makes dumberjs
```

You will be prompted to provide a project name and few selections to generate a front-end project using `Aurelia`, `React`, or `Vue` framework.
