# Legacy JavaScript library

> It's very rare nowadays for a JavaScript library not supporting any module format. When you encounter them, it's probably better to find a better alternative, or send them a PR (pull request).

There are two ways to incorporate legacy JavaScript libraries into your app, [shim](../options/deps#shim) or [prepend](../options/prepend-and-append).

Read [shim guide](../options/deps#shim) for more details.
